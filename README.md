# Security Problem Design — Cryptography & Blockchain Labs

This repository contains a collection of **security labs designed as a teaching assistant**
for an Information Security course.

Each project focuses on **realistic cryptographic or blockchain vulnerabilities** and is
structured to help students reason about *why* a system fails, not just *how* to exploit it.

The emphasis is on **problem design, threat modeling, and learning objectives** rather than
providing ready-made solutions.
